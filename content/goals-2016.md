Title: 2016 Goals

Summary: I've never had much luck sticking to New Year's resolutions. Making and indefinitely sticking with major life changes without concrete success criteria seems almost always doomed to fail. Instead, I've identified a bunch of bite-sized goals that can be completed in a month. Each month presents a new opportunity to work on something different. They aren't in any particular order, and I'm free to choose whichever one I want to work off at the beginning of each month. I figure if I succeed in completing 75% of these goals, I'm doing pretty well.

I've never had much luck sticking to New Year's resolutions. Making and indefinitely sticking with major life changes without concrete success criteria seems almost always doomed to fail. Instead, I've identified a bunch of bite-sized goals that can be completed in a month. Each month presents a new opportunity to work on something different. They aren't in any particular order, and I'm free to choose whichever one I want to work off at the beginning of each month. I figure if I succeed in completing 75% of these goals, I'm doing pretty well.


#### **January** - Digital housecleaning
This one is a necessary evil, but is super important and something I tend to overlook throughout the year. This year I'd like to:

* Convert my NAS (which is currently set up with only one drive) to RAID1
* Migrate the numerous hard drives full of data I have laying around to the NAS 
* Ensure critical data is backed up offsite (as a stretch, I'd like to automate this) 
* Sort through the nearly 2700 photos I took on my phone this year
* Complete my migration to Apple's iCloud services (primarily Contacts and Keychain)
* Consolidate cloud accounts. I'd like to migrate everything to AWS

#### **February** - Fingernails

#### `vim` as my only editor
I spend all day in various editors (MATLAB, Sublime Text, and vim). It's time to bite the bullet and consolidate.

#### Read In Defense of Food by Michael Pollan
I saw the PBS documentary based on this book at the end of 2015. He presented what seemed like a well thought out approach to healthy eating. I'd like to read more. 


#### Update resume, LinkedIn, personal website
This, like digital housecleaning is a necessary evil. Once a year seems often enough.

#### Buy an Eames Lounge Chair
These chairs are amazing. They are also amazingly expensive. In order to offset the astronomical cost of ownership, we've got a bunch of things to sell first:

* Our old queen mattress
* My old mountain bike
* Extra avalanche gear I have laying around
* Some old jewelry 

#### Wisdom teeth
Self explanatory. They need to come out this year.

#### Cook breakfast before work every morning

#### Bring lunch to work every day

#### KonMari the apartment

#### Focus on monocle

#### Take a vacation
Both in real life and from this list. This one is basically a gimmie.

I've also included two goals that will require the whole year to satisfy. These aren't so much behavioral changes as they are quantifiable goals. 

#### Save $10,000

#### Bike 1000km / climb 100,000ft
