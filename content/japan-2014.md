Sometime during the winter of 2012/13, I committed to going on an international ski trip. The 2011/12 and 2012/13 winters had been mild in the Sierra (at when least compared with the previous few years), making the promise of loads of fresh snow impossible to resist. The original plan was to do the [Haute Route](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_Route) through the Alps, but we quickly learned it entailed too much touring, not enough descending, and is not terribly splitboard friendly. A little more digging led us to Hokkaido - Japan's northern-most island. After departing Siberia on its eastward journey around the globe, the jet stream hits Hokkaido and blankets it in more white powder than Miami in the 80's.

Nine months later, ANA delivered my friend Jon and I to Tokyo. We were immediately greeted with 18" of snow (the most the city has seen in over 30 years), slowing Tokyo's supposed frantic pace to a crawl. Our friend Danny, scheduled to arrive from Albany that same night, would end up stuck in Atlanta also due to a rare snowstorm.

Danny arrived the next day, the snow melted, and we added ourselves to Tokyo's 37 million residents - at least temporarily. The city is enormous and would easily take years to fully explore. We stuck to the standard "must visit" districts but left satisfied that we had experienced a good bit of what Tokyo has to offer. Ramen, yakitori, tempura, and plenty of sake kept us going for our four day visit. A bit of food poisoning kept me sidelined for a day, missing the Tsukiji fish market and dinner at a Michelin-starred sushi restaurant. Tokyo standouts included the Skytree, Asakusa and the Sensoji Temple, a twelve story electronics store (with an entire floor devoted to iPhone 5 cases), and the Nigerians in Roppongi pushing the "all you can eat, all you can drink, all you can touch" club experience.

Fifteen thousand yen ($150 US) and a few hours later, the Shinkansen bullet train delivered us to Kyoto.

Visiting UNESCO World Heritage Sites (Kiyomizudera Temple), the endless orange gates of the Fushimi Inari Shrine, and the bamboo groves and monkey park in Arashiyama kept us busy.

As Bill Murray taught everyone in  Lost in Translation, Japan loves Whisky. After beer, it seems to be the go-to drink of choice. Jon’s friend Tyler arranged for us to tour the Suntory distillery in Kyoto (free, but reservations are required and must be made in Japanese). The tour was about what you would expect from any other major distiller: lots of history, some copper stills, and a musty room full of barrels. Suntory differentiated themselves by having a.) an honest to God whisky library and b.) a bar which poured very reasonably priced tastes of a wide assortment of whisky. I always wanted to try whisky as old as myself, and for 3,000 yen I was staring the Hibiki 30 in the face. An absolutely stunning dram (easily earned its title of “best blended whisky in the world” as far as I’m concerned), I felt even better about my $30 taste after I came home and learned the bottles regularly sell for more than $1500 US.

After a week of successfully reinforcing every stereotype about obnoxious American tourists, we were off to Hokkaido for phase two of the trip. Danny returned to Tokyo via train while Jon and I flew to Sapporo.

An uneventful flight and bus ride later, we arrived at the [Black Diamond Lodge](http://www.bdlodge.com/) in Niseko. Yup, lots of snow:

![Just a little bit of snow.]({filename}/img/photo-essay-japan-2014/black-diamond-lodge.jpg)

We spent the first day riding the resort in Niseko. Having received 30cm snow the night before, we were pretty excited to finally be shredding some Japow. As expected, the runs in bounds were pretty quickly tracked out, but we were able to find some pockets of fresh snow to ourselves after ducking a few ropes. Surprisingly, the locals tend to stay in bounds - even when it’s completely tracked out. This left us plenty of opportunities to lay down fresh tracks out of bounds, and the gettin’ was good:

At this point in the trip, something strange happened: it stopped snowing. What had been a very odd winter in the US (essentially no snow in the Sierra while Atlanta experienced multiple major snow storms) seemed to follow us to Japan. High pressure dominated, leaving us with rare clear skies and no appreciable new snow for the entirety of our week on Hokkaido. Without our amazing guides, our trip would have been a bust. They managed to find us the best snow on the island, despite an odd weather forecast.

Hard to tell it hasn’t snowed for a while:

We did at least a little touring every day but the last day. I got very familiar with my snowboard looking like skis.

Bootpacking up the side of an icy volcano without crampons: not one of the most relaxing things I’ve ever done…

Our best day (and probably the single greatest day of snowboarding in my life) was at Tokachi-dake.

Incredible views from the top:

After three laps, we were spent. Thankfully, the convenience store near the base of the mountain sold beer. After downing a few, we headed for the local onsen to sit uncomfortably close to other naked men and soothe our sore muscles. All you can eat sushi soon followed. It was a very good day.

By the time we were done we explored a decent chunk of Hokkaido, riding at Niseko, Kokusai, Kiroro and Mt. Yochi-dake, Asahidake, Tokachi-dake (technically San Dam Yama), Tomamu, and Teine. We finished our trip at an all you can eat, all you can drink place in downtown Sapporo surrounded by hammered Japanese kids. The guy on the right (below) walked in to the bar sober and after three sips of his beer, was ferociously drunk. This was about par for the course. I love Japan.

Finally, this trip marked the end of an era for me: I retired the only pair of snowboard boots I’ve ever owned. Purchased in 1996, they served me well for 18 seasons. ![AK]({filename}/img/ak.png)
