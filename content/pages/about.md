I'm an engineer at NASA's [Jet Propulaion Laboratory](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov) where I work on designing, modeling and analyzing wavefront sensing and control systems for a variety of optical instruments. I have a Bachelor's Degree from the University of Maryland and a Master's Degree from UCLA, both in aerospace engineering.
