## Installation
1. Clone this repo (preferably into a virtualenv)

2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

That's it!

## Write content
* Articles go in `content`, images go in `content/img`, and other files go in `content/files`. 
* Images and files are accessed like so:
 
    ![Tooltip]({filename}/img/image.png)

* `blank.md` is a blank article template. It provides placeholders for commonly used article metadata.
* Articles can be saved as drafts by adding `Status: draft` to the metadata.
* Syntax highlighting is supported by including the three semicolons and  language identifier immediately above a block of code. I'm sure there are a ton of language identifiers. I use `bash`, `python`, `matlab`, and `tex`.
* LaTeX support is provided by MathJax. Wrap inline equations with `$` and full-line equations with `$$`.
* Slick gallery support coming soon
